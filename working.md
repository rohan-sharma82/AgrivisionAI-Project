# AgriVision AI: How It Works

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the AgriVision AI application, explaining its architecture, technologies, features, and key components. Its purpose is to serve as a comprehensive guide for understanding how the project is built and functions.

## 1. High-Level Architecture & Philosophy

AgriVision AI is built as a modern, server-centric web application. This means most of the heavy lifting (like rendering pages and running AI models) is done on the server, and a lightweight, fast, and interactive user interface is sent to the user's device. This architecture is ideal for our target audience in rural areas, who may have low-bandwidth internet connections.

- **Frontend-Backend Decoupling**: While Next.js handles both frontend and backend logic, we've intentionally separated the AI logic into its own set of "flows" using Google Genkit. This makes the AI functionality modular, easy to test, and maintain.
- **Component-Based UI**: The user interface is built from small, reusable React components, which keeps the code organized and consistent.
- **Stateless by Design**: The application is currently stateless, meaning it doesn't rely on a central database. It uses the user's browser (`localStorage`) to remember settings like chat history and location. This makes it incredibly easy to deploy and scale on serverless platforms like Vercel.
- **Multilingual First**: The app was designed from the ground up to be multilingual, using a centralized translation system to support various Indian languages.

## 2. Technology Stack Deep Dive

### Frontend

- **Next.js (with App Router)**: We use Next.js, a powerful React framework.
  - **Why?**: It provides an excellent development experience and enables key performance optimizations.
  - **App Router**: This is the newer routing system in Next.js. It allows us to use **React Server Components**, which render on the server. This drastically reduces the amount of JavaScript sent to the client, making the app load very quickly. Pages like the homepage, news feed, and government schemes are rendered on the server. Interactive pages like the AI chat or prediction forms are "Client Components" because they require user interaction.

- **React & TypeScript**:
  - **React**: The foundation of our UI, allowing us to build interactive and stateful components.
  - **TypeScript**: We use TypeScript to add static types to our JavaScript code. This helps catch errors early, improves code quality, and makes the project easier to maintain as it grows.

### UI & Styling

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework.
  - **Why?**: Instead of writing custom CSS files, we build designs directly in our HTML/JSX. This is much faster and helps maintain a consistent design system.

- **ShadCN UI**: A collection of pre-built, accessible, and beautifully designed UI components.
  - **Why?**: It provides the building blocks for our app (like Buttons, Cards, Dialogs, Forms) out of the box, saving a huge amount of development time. It's built on top of Tailwind CSS, so it's easy to customize to match our theme.
  - **`components.json`**: This file configures how ShadCN components are integrated into our project.

- **Framer Motion**: A library for creating fluid animations.
  - **Why?**: We use it to add subtle, professional animations that improve the user experience, such as the animated feature cards, the "gooey" buttons on the homepage, and the smooth appearance of chat messages.

### AI & Backend Logic

- **Google Genkit**: The heart of our AI capabilities.
  - **Why?**: Genkit is a framework specifically designed for building production-ready AI applications. It allows us to define AI "flows" which are like server-side functions that can call AI models, use tools, and return structured data.
  - **Flows (`src/ai/flows/`)**: Each core AI feature has its own flow file (e.g., `ai-farmer-assistant.ts`). This flow defines:
    1.  **Input/Output Schemas (with Zod)**: We use Zod to define the exact shape of the data we expect to receive (input) and send back (output). This enforces data integrity.
    2.  **Prompt Templates**: The instructions we give to the AI model. We use Handlebars syntax (`{{{...}}}`) to insert user data into the prompt dynamically.
    3.  **Model Calls**: The code that actually calls the Google Gemini model.
    4.  **Tool Usage**: The ability for a flow to use external tools, like our `weather.ts` tool.

- **Google AI Platform (Gemini Models)**:
  - **Why?**: We use Google's powerful Gemini family of models. They have excellent reasoning capabilities for the text-based AI assistant and strong multi-modal (text and image) capabilities for the disease and animal classification features.

- **WeatherAPI**:
  - **Why?**: To make our AI Farmer Assistant truly "smart," it needs real-world context. We use the WeatherAPI to fetch current weather data for a user's location.
  - **Genkit Tool (`src/ai/tools/weather.ts`)**: We've wrapped the WeatherAPI call inside a Genkit "tool". This allows our AI Farmer flow to *decide for itself* when it needs to fetch the weather to provide a better answer (e.g., if a user asks about spraying pesticides, the AI can check if it's about to rain).

### State Management & Localization

- **React Context (`useAppProvider.tsx`)**: For global state that needs to be shared across the entire application, we use React's built-in Context API. Our `AppProvider` manages:
  - The user's selected language.
  - The user's location.
- **`localStorage`**: A simple storage mechanism in the user's browser. We use it to persist simple data so the user doesn't have to set it every time they visit.
  - `ai-farmer-messages`: Stores the chat history for the AI Farmer Assistant.
  - `user-location`: Stores the location entered in the initial dialog.
  - `language`: Stores the user's preferred language.
- **Localization Files (`src/locales/*.json`)**: We have a separate JSON file for each supported language (English, Punjabi, etc.). Each file contains a key-value map of all the text in the app. The `useTranslation` hook reads from the correct file based on the user's selected language.

## 3. Feature Breakdown

### **Homepage (`/page.tsx`)**
- **Animated Beam**: This visual effect is created by the `AnimatedBeam` component, which calculates the positions of the user and AI icons and draws a curved SVG path between them. Framer Motion animates a gradient along this path to create the "beam" effect.
- **TextPressure Component**: A creative text component that dynamically changes font weight and width based on the mouse cursor's position, creating an interactive "pressure" effect.
- **Feature Cards**: A set of cards that link to the main features. They use Framer Motion for a 3D flip effect on hover, making the UI feel more dynamic and engaging.
- **News Feed**: This section fetches articles from a static list in `src/lib/constants.ts`. It uses React state (`useState`) to manage the currently selected category and filters the articles accordingly. When a user clicks "Read More", it opens a ShadCN `Dialog` component to display the full article content.

### **AI Farmer (`/ai-farmer/page.tsx`)**
- **Chat Interface**: The core of this page is the `messages` state array, which stores the conversation history. The UI simply maps over this array to display user and assistant messages.
- **Form Handling**: We use `react-hook-form` for managing the user's text input, which is more efficient than using simple state for forms.
- **AI Integration**: When the form is submitted, the `getFarmingAdvice` function is called. This is a Server Action that invokes our Genkit flow on the backend.
- **Weather Tool**: If the user has provided a location, it is passed to the flow. The flow then uses the `getWeatherForLocation` tool to fetch real-time weather, which the Gemini model uses to provide more contextual advice.
- **Speech-to-Text**: It uses the browser's native `SpeechRecognition` API. The `toggleRecording` function starts and stops the microphone. When speech is recognized, the transcript is placed into the form input and submitted automatically.
- **Text-to-Speech**: After receiving a text response from the AI, the `textToSpeech` Genkit flow is called. This flow uses a specialized Gemini model to convert the text into audio data, which is then sent back and embedded in an `<audio>` element.

### **Crop Yield, Disease & Animal Classification Pages**
These three pages follow a similar pattern:
1.  **Input**: The user provides input—either through a form (`CropYieldPage`) or by uploading an image (`DiseaseClassificationPage`, `AnimalClassificationPage`).
2.  **File Handling**: For image uploads, a `FileReader` is used to convert the selected image file into a Base64-encoded Data URI. This is a standard way to represent an image as a string so it can be easily sent in a JSON payload to our backend.
3.  **API Call**: The relevant Genkit flow function is called with the user's input.
4.  **Loading State**: A loading spinner is shown while the AI is processing the request.
5.  **Display Results**: The structured JSON data returned from the Genkit flow is then displayed in a formatted result card, often using components like `Progress` bars to visualize confidence scores.

### **Internationalization (i18n)**
- **`AppProvider`**: This is the top-level provider in `layout.tsx` that holds the current language state.
- **`useTranslation` Hook**: A custom hook that provides any component with access to the `t` function (for translating keys) and the `setLanguage` function.
- **JSON Files (`/locales`)**: All display text is stored as key-value pairs. For example, `home.welcome` maps to "Welcome to AgriVision AI" in `en.json` and "एग्रिविजन एआई में आपका स्वागत है" in `hi.json` (if it were added). This separation of code and content makes adding new languages very easy.
