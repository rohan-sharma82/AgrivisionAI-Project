In case the revision of the scale of finance for any year by the district-level committee exceeds the notional hike of 10% contemplated while fixing the five-year limit, a revised drawable limit may be fixed and the farmer is advised about the same. In case such revisions require the card limit itself to be enhanced (4th or 5th year), the same may be done and the farmer be so advised. For term loans, instalments may be allowed to be withdrawn based on the nature of the investment and the repayment schedule drawn as per the economic life of the proposed investments.

Each farmer will receive a 60% subsidy to set up tube wells and pump sets. They will also get 30% of the total cost as a loan from the Government.</p><h4>Objective / Purpose</h4><p>The primary objective of the PM KUSUM Scheme is to make cutting-edge technology available to our farmers and provide sources for de-dieselized irrigation to the agricultural sector. The main objectives of this scheme are:</p><ul><li>The solar pumps assist our farmers in much more effective and eco-friendly irrigation as these are capable of generating safer energy.</li><li>In addition, the pump sets comprise an energy power grid that generates more energy than diesel-driven pumps. Farmers will be able to sell the extra power to our Government directly to enhance their income.</li></ul><h4>Components of KUSUM Scheme</h4><ul><li><strong>Component A:</strong> Install a total of 10GV grid-connected stilt-mounted decentralized solar plants and other renewable energy-based power plants.

This leads our farmers to bear only 10% of the total cost to install solar plants and solar pumps.</li><li>As per the KUSUM Scheme details, our Government will provide subsidies to install state-of-the-art solar pumps. They improve irrigation as they hold 720MV of capacity.</li><li>This scheme offers our farmers an opportunity of selling the extra power generated by the plants directly to our Government. This ensures the scope of increase in the income of our farmers.</li><li>A landholder in a rural area can get a stable source of income by utilizing barren and uncultivated land for solar plant implementation for 25 years.</li><li>The solar plants will be set up above a minimum height in cultivable lands. This way, our farmers will be able to continue with cultivation after installing the plants.</li><li>KUSUM Scheme ensures increasing use of renewable energy helps to mitigate pollution in farms and opens a gateway to eco-friendly cultivation</li></ul><h4>Eligibility</h4><p>The eligible categories for KUSUM Scheme are:</p><ul><li>An individual farmer.</li><li>A group of farmers.</li><li>FPO or Farmer producer organization.</li><li>Panchayat.</li><li>Co-operatives.</li><li>Water User Associations.</li></ul><h4>Application Process</h4><h5>Online</h5><p>Interested individuals can apply for KUSUM Scheme by following the procedures stated below -</p><ol><li>Go to the official portal and click on the registration section.</li><li>Fill in the registration form that appears on your screen with all the required details.</li><li>Check the box of declaration and click on ‚Äúsubmit‚Äù.</li><li>After registering, click on ‚Äúlog in‚Äù for Solar Agricultural Pumpset Subsidy Scheme 2021.</li><li>Provide all necessary information accurately in the online application form, attach all the supporting documents, and submit.</li></ol><p><strong>Note:</strong> After a successful online application for KUSUM Scheme, farmers must deposit 10% of the total cost to set up a solar pump to the supplier sent by the department.

            "description": "<h4>What is a Soil Health Card?</h4><p>SHC is a printed report that a farmer will be handed over for each of his holdings. It will contain the status of his soil with respect to 12 parameters, namely N,P,K (Macro-nutrients); S (Secondary- nutrient); Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, Bo (Micro - nutrients); and pH, EC, OC (Physical parameters). Based on this, the SHC will also indicate fertilizer recommendations and soil amendment required for the farm.</p><h4>How can a farmer use a SHC?</h4><p>The card will contain an advisory based on the soil nutrient status of a farmer's holding. It will show recommendations on dosage of different nutrients needed. Further, it will advise the farmer on the fertilizers and their quantities he should apply, and also the soil amendments that he should undertake, so as to realize optimal yields.</p><h4>What are the norms of sampling?</h4><p>Soil samples will be drawn in a grid of 2.5 ha in irrigated area and 10 ha in rain- fed area with the help of GPS tools and revenue maps.</p><h4>Who will draw the soil sample?</h4><p>The State Government will collect samples through the staff of their Department of Agriculture or through the staff of an outsourced agency. The State Government may also involve the students of local Agriculture / Science Colleges.</p><h4>What is the ideal time for soil sampling?</h4><p>Soil Samples are taken generally two times in a year, after harvesting of Rabi and Kharif Crop respectively or when there is no standing crop in the field.</p><h4>Who and Where will the soil sample be tested?</h4><p>The soil sample will be tested as per the approved standards for all the agreed 12 parameters in the following way:</p><ul><li>At the STLs owned by the Department of Agriculture and by their own staff.</li><li>At the STLs owned by the Department of Agriculture but by the staff of the outsourced agency.</li><li>At the STLs owned by the outsourced agency and by their staff.</li><li>At ICAR Institutions including KVKs and SAUs.</li><li>At the laboratories of the Science Colleges/Universities by the students under supervision of a Professor/ Scientist.</li></ul><h4>What is the payment per sample?</h4><p>A sum of Rs. 190 per soil sample is provided to State Governments. This covers the cost of collection of soil sample, its test, generation and distribution of soil health card to the farmer.</p><h4>Benefits of the Soil Health Card Scheme</h4><ul><li>The scheme will monitor the soil of the farmers well and will give them a formatted report. So, they can decide well which crops they should cultivate and which ones they should skip.</li><li>The authorities will monitor the soil on a regular basis. One in every 3 years, they will provide a report to farmers. So, farmers need not worry if the nature of the soil changes due to certain factors. Also, they will always have updated data about their soil.</li><li>The work of the government does not stop at listing down measures required to improve the quality of the soil. In fact, they will also employ experts to help farmers in carrying out the corrective measures.</li><li>Farmers will get a proper soil health record, thanks to the Soil Health Card Scheme. Also, they can study the soil management practices. Accordingly, they can plan the future of their crops and land.</li><li>Generally, in government schemes, the person carrying out the study for a particular farmer gets changed. But in the Soil Health Card Scheme, the government is paying attention that the same person carries out soil analysis for a farmer. This will further enhance the effectiveness of the scheme.</li><li>The soil card will give the farmers a proper idea of which nutrients their soil is lacking. And hence, which crops they should invest in. they will also tell which fertilizers they need. So, ultimately, the crop yield will see a rise.</li><li>The main aim behind the scheme was to find out the type of particular soil. And then provide ways in which we can improve it. Even if a soil has some limitations, we can do something to get the most out of it. And that is what the government is trying to do with the help of this scheme.</li></ul>"
