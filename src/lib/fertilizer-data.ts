    {
      name: "Urea",
      description: "A high-concentration nitrogen fertilizer (46% N). It's one of the most common nitrogen fertilizers used worldwide. It must be converted in the soil before plants can use it, a process that can lead to nitrogen loss if not managed properly."
    },
    {
      name: "Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)",
      description: "A popular phosphate fertilizer. It contains both nitrogen (18%) and phosphorus (46%). It is highly soluble and provides readily available phosphorus to plants."
    },
    {
      name: "Muriate of Potash (MOP)",
      description: "Also known as Potassium Chloride. It is the most common potassium source used in agriculture, containing about 60-62% Kâ‚‚O. It's suitable for most crops except those sensitive to chloride."
    },
    {
      name: "Single Super Phosphate (SSP)",
      description: "One of the earliest chemical fertilizers. It contains phosphorus (16%), calcium (19%), and sulfur (12%). It is particularly useful in soils deficient in sulfur."
    },
    {
      name: "NPK Complexes",
      description: "These are fertilizers that contain two or more of the primary nutrients: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K). They are formulated in various ratios (e.g., 10-26-26, 12-32-16, 20-20-0) to meet the specific needs of different crops and soils."
    },
    {
      name: "Ammonium Sulphate",
      description: "Contains nitrogen (21%) and a significant amount of sulfur (24%). It's a good choice for crops with high sulfur requirements, like oilseeds, and can help lower the pH of alkaline soils."
    },
    {
      name: "Zinc Sulphate",
      description: "A micronutrient fertilizer used to correct zinc deficiency in soils, which is a common issue in many agricultural areas. Zinc is crucial for enzyme function and plant growth."
