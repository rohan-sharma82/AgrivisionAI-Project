      name: "Urea",
      description: "A high-concentration nitrogen fertilizer (46% N). It helps plants grow fast, makes them green, and increases leaf and stem growth. Note: If not managed well, some nitrogen can be lost, so it must be used carefully."
    },
    {
      name: "Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)",
      description: "Contains both nitrogen (18%) for growth and greenness, and phosphorus (46%) for strong roots, flowers, and fruits. It dissolves quickly, so plants can use it fast."
    },
    {
      name: "Muriate of Potash (MOP)",
      description: "Also known as Potassium Chloride (60-62% Kâ‚‚O). It makes plants strong, improves resistance to drought and disease, and helps in fruit/seed development. It's not ideal for crops sensitive to chloride (like tobacco or grapes)."
    },
    {
      name: "Single Super Phosphate (SSP)",
      description: "Contains phosphorus (16%) for root growth, calcium (19%) for strong cell walls, and sulfur (12%) for improving the quality of oilseeds and pulses. It's very good for soils that lack sulfur."

    {
      name: "NPK Complexes",
      description: "A mix of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in various ratios (e.g., 10-26-26). It provides a balanced diet: N for growth, P for roots & flowers, and K for strength. The ratio is chosen based on crop needs."

    {
      name: "Ammonium Sulphate",
      description: "Contains nitrogen (21%) and a large amount of sulfur. The sulfur helps improve the taste, quality, and oil content in crops like onions, garlic, and oilseeds."

    {
      name: "Zinc Sulphate",
      description: "A micronutrient fertilizer used to correct zinc deficiency in soils, which is a common issue in many agricultural areas. Zinc is crucial for enzyme function and plant growth."
