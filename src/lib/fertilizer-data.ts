      name: "Urea",
      description: "What it is: A fertilizer that has a lot of nitrogen (46%).\nWhy helpful: Nitrogen helps plants grow fast, makes them green, and increases leaf and stem growth.\nNote: If not managed well, some nitrogen can escape into the air or water, so farmers need to use it carefully."
    },
    {
      name: "Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)",
      description: "What it is: Fertilizer that gives both nitrogen (18%) and phosphorus (46%).\nWhy helpful:\nNitrogen = growth and greenness.\nPhosphorus = strong roots, better flowers, and fruits.\nIt dissolves quickly, so plants can use it fast."
    },
    {
      name: "Muriate of Potash (MOP)",
      description: "What it is: Also called Potassium Chloride, with 60–62% potassium.\nWhy helpful: Potassium makes plants strong, improves resistance to drought and disease, and helps in fruit/seed development.\nNot good for: Crops sensitive to chloride (like tobacco, grapes)."
    },
    {
      name: "Single Super Phosphate (SSP)",
      description: "What it is: An old but still useful fertilizer with 16% phosphorus, 19% calcium, and 12% sulfur.\nWhy helpful:\nPhosphorus → root growth.\nCalcium → strong cell walls.\nSulfur → better quality of oilseeds and pulses.\nVery good for soils lacking sulfur."
    },
    {
      name: "NPK Complex Fertilizers",
      description: "What it is: A mix of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in different ratios (like 10-26-26).\nWhy helpful: Gives a balanced diet to plants—\nN = growth,\nP = roots & flowers,\nK = strength & disease resistance.\nFarmers choose the ratio depending on crop needs."
    },
    {
      name: "Ammonium Sulphate",
      description: "What it is: Fertilizer with 21% nitrogen + lots of sulfur.\nWhy helpful:\nNitrogen = plant growth.\nSulfur = improves taste, quality, and oil content in crops.\nUseful for crops like onion, garlic, and oilseeds."
